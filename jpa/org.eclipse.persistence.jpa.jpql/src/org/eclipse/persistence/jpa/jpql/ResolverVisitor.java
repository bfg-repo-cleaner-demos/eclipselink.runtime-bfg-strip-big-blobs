/**
 * The interface is used to traverse some of the subclasses of {@link Resolver}. This visitor is
 * meant to traverse state field path expressions and collection-valued path expressions. The
 * hierarchy of resolving a path expression looks like this:
 * <p><pre>
 * EntityResolver
 * or
 * CollectionValuedFieldResolver
 * or
 * TreatResolver
 *  |
 *  -> IdentificationVariableResolver
 *      |
 *      (optional KeyResolver or ValueResolver)
 *      |
 *      -> StateFieldResolver
 *          |
 *        1...n
 *          |
 *          -> StateFieldResolver or CollectionValuedFieldResolver</pre>
 *
 * Provisional API: This interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and
 * expected to change significantly before reaching stability. It is available at this early stage
 * to solicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this
 * API will almost certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
