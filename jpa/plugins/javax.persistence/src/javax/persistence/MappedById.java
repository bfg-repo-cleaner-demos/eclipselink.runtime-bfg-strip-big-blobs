/**
 * Is used to designate a <code>ManyToOne</code> or
 * <code>OneToOne</code> relationship attribute that corresponds to an
 * {@link EmbeddedId} primary key, an attribute within an
 * <code>EmbeddedId</code> primary key, or a simple primary key of the
 * parent entity. The <code>value</code> element specifies the
 * attribute within a composite key to which the relationship
 * attribute corresponds. If the entity's primary key is of the same
 * Java type as the primary key of the entity referenced by the
 * relationship, the value attribute is not specified.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    Example:
 *
 *    // parent entity has simple primary key
 *
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    public class Employee {
 *       &#064;Id long empId;
 *       String name;
 *       ...
 *    } 
 *
 *    // dependent entity uses EmbeddedId for composite key
 *
 *    &#064;Embeddable
 *    public class DependentId {
 *       String name;
 *       long empid;   // corresponds to PK type of Employee
 *    }
 *
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    public class Dependent {
 *       &#064;EmbeddedId DependentId id;
 *        ...
 *       &#064;MappedById("empid")  //  maps to empid attribute of embedded id
 *       &#064;ManyToOne Employee emp;
 *    }
 * </pre>
