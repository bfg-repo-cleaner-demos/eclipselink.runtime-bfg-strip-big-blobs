Java Persistence 2.0 - Proposed Final Draft (March 13, 2009)
Specification available from http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317

 Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.0 - EARLY ACCESS
 This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the 
 Java Community Process (JCP).  The code is untested and presumed not to be a  
 compatible implementation of JSR 317: Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.0.   
 We encourage you to migrate to an implementation of the Java(TM) Persistence 
 API, Version 2.0 Specification that has been tested and verified to be compatible 
 as soon as such an implementation is available, and we encourage you to retain 
 this notice in any implementation of Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.0 
 Specification that you distribute.

For OSGi users, the version dependency for javax.persistence needs to be
specified as 1.99 to utilize this jar.
