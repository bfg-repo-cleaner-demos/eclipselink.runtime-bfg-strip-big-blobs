<h3><a name="ASM" id="ASM"></a>ASM v1.5.3 </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Eclipse Persistence Services Project includes ASM for the purpose of 
    byte code weaving. The AMS library is re-packaged within the source of the 
    project (org.persistence.eclipse.internal.libraries.asm.*) to avoid version 
    collisions with other usage of ASM. A custom patch has been added to the ASM 
    1.5.3 source to handle an issue with the Oracle Java Compiler. This fix has 
    also been contributed back to the ASM project for inclusion in later projects. 
  </p>
  <p>The source code is available within the project's subversion repository.</p>
